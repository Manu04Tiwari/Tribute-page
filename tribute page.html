                <h2><i>Beatrice Shilling</i></h2>
                <p>This celebrated motorcycle racer and aeronautical engineer designed a solution that helped save the
                    lives of British airforce pilots during World War II. In 1940, amidst the Battle of Britain and the
                    Battle of France,
                    the pilots of the Royal Air Force were experiencing a serious problem that endangered their lives.

                <h2><i>Katherine Johnson</i></h2>
                <p>Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, in 1918. Johnson worked on a number of projects at
                    NACA, including analyzing data from flight tests. In 1958, she provided some of the math for a
                    series of lectures given by engineers in the Flight Research Division.
                    Johnson retired in 1986, after 33 years at NACA/NASA. In 2015, at age 97, Johnson was awarded the
                    Presidential Medal of Freedom, Americaâ€™s highest civilian honor.
